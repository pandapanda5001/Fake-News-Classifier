# Fake-News Classifier with Scikit-Learn

Fake news classifier which uses the Naive-Bayes Algorithm for classification. Two NLP techniques were used  here and the TfidfVectorizer was treated with hyperparameter-tuning to improve the results. I have done my best to have an interactive walk-through throughout the notebook!

# Dependencies

* Python
* Scipy, sklearn, pandas, matplotlib

# Results

- CountVectorizer yielded an accuracy of 90.2%
- TfidfVectorizer yielded an accuracy of 86.3% and maximum accuracy of 90.4% post tuning.
